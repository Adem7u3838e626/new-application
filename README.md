# 🛰 Remote IP Logger & Reverse Shell Server

This project allows a client machine to send its local and public IP to a server, which logs it. After receiving the IP info, the server automatically launches a remote shell interface to interact with the client.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.9 or later  
- OS: Windows or Linux  
- Internet connection (for public IP detection)
